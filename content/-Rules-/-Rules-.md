All of the rules for the campaign shall be recorded here over time.
If you notice them fall out of date, let me know.

# Adults Only
Your character must be an adult for their given race, no children.

# Starting Level
We will be starting at level 1. Which means you are most likely squishy, and just starting your adventuring career.  Keep this in mind when writing a backstory, slaying a dragon isn't exactly a level 1 feat. Though if you want to have a cool backstory go for it, just need to explain why you are a level 1 chump by the time of campaign start.

# Health
At level 1 you take max health as normal. When you level up you may take average health, or you may roll it. Re-rolling is allowed on 1/4 of your hit dice value, rounded down. E.G A sorcerer with a D6 hit dice can only re-roll a 1, but a barbarian with a D12 hit dice can re-roll on a 1, 2 or 3.

# Ability Score Method
We are using point buy, the reason why is for fairness and balance. You will however you will gain an extra Feat at level 1, granting build flexibility and cooler characters. Additionally we are using the option to customise your origin, meaning you can swap the ASIs that you'd normally get from your race for ones that fit your character, allowing for more species flexibility.

# Tasha's Optional Features
Tasha's cauldron of everything added a lot of optional class features. All the optional class features are allowed, though they aren't properly integrated into the roll20 charactermancer yet, so you'll have to manually look up and apply them. You can use the options for customising races as mentioned above, but not the full custom race.

# Homebrew Rules
These rules aren't standard 5e, but they will be used for this campaign.
- Drinking a potion.
	- Most potions must be drank as an action. 
	- Healing potions are an exception. You may drink a healing potion as a bonus action, and roll the healing received. However, if you choose to drink a healing potion as an action you receive the maximum possible healing.
	- Other potions may be considered for this bonus action rule, if a similar cost benefit can be decided upon.
- Flanking provides a +2 to attack rolls.
- Standing from prone incurs an attack of opportunity from all creatures within 5ft.
- Extra proficiencies based on intelligence. You gain a number of proficiencies equal to your intelligence modifier. This can be a tool, language or skill proficiency.
- The fall damage cap is increased to 1000d6, sudden deceleration is a bitch.
- Attuning to an magic item does not tell you it's capabilities. You must spend time studying the item, using spells or other methods to determine it's abilities. In addition identifying an items abilities can be difficult, with some abilities being harder to determine than others.
- [[Injury Rules]] If you go down you will have a chance to get injured. Good luck.
- [[Death Rules]] Coming back to life is taken for granted, not anymore.
  
# An issue of Naming

Some spells and abilities include the names of people or places. Such as Hunger of Hadar or Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion. Such things will need to be renamed/reflavoured as those entities or places don't exist in the setting.
