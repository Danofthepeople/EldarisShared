# Honorifics
The Faithful Guide, The Blackened Hound, The Soul Warden, The Grim Harvest, The End.

# Description
The God of death often has a bad reputation, but without Oren the world be a tragic place. A world without death would be one where pains would mount over time, unable to be healed. No chance to find release, just a slow climb into madness as the pain becomes too much to bear. Then in mad agony you would stay forever. Thus, we pray to Oren to bring an end to life, we trust in Oren to decide which afterlife each soul deserves.
