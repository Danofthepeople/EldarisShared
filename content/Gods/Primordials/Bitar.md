# Circumstances Of Creation
When mortals began farming they initially prayed to [[Kihena]], the god of nature. This caused Kihena's domain, and consequently power to grow. Eventually Kihena's domain exceeded their ability to control it, and so Kihena split into two gods. Kihena retained power over the wilds, while Bitar was born as the god of harvest.
