# Description
She is the moon in the night sky, the soft light that guides mortals through dark times. She also presides over the dreams that come to mortals in the night. Though sometimes she leads the weary astray, to turn them into therianthropes. She, like [[Azrus]], has cycles of power, while his last a single day, she waxes and wanes over the course of a month. At her zenith she shines almost as bright as the sun, at her nadir the nights become as black as tar.
