# Description
Why would we pray to a God of storms? Is it to shield ourselves from their wrath, or so that their wrath may fall on our enemies. Perhaps it is so the storms will grant us strength, for there is nothing more thrilling than a battle, In The Red Storm. All feel the beat of the war drums, all drive themselves beyond the limit, none will yield.

# Circumstances Of Creation
Created when [[Udona]], the god of air, fought [[Yrdis]], the god of water. Their twinned hatred created its own entity, which became the soul of the storm. Though the gods are at peace now, the storm still rages on without them.
