# Description
Udona is the unseen that we can never be without. To refuse their embrace would kill you, for they are the air we breathe. They are the gentle breeze on a warm summer day, they are the typhoon destroying all in their path with unseen fury. Udona is with us always, we pray to them to keep the wind at our back, and the gales far away.
