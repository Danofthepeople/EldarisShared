Injuries can be applied to PCs and NPCs alike, though NPC injuries should only really be considered when the NPC is of major relevance. When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points they must make a Constitution saving throw, the DC for this save equals 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher. On a successful save the creature receives no injury. On a failed save, the creature must roll a D20 to see what injury they receive. A creature may only receive one injury per combat.

Injuries range in severity, with 20 being the least severe and 1 being the most. Each injury also has a severity ranking that can be used to determine the cost of magical healing. These can be Debilitating, Major, Minor or Trifling.
