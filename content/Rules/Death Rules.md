# Rapid Resurrection
When a spell that brings back the dead, with a casting time of one action or less is cast, follow the rapid resurrection rules. Ask for a spellcasting ability check from the caster, and note the modifier returned from the list below. Check the Permanent Modifiers of the target. Then roll a d20 adding the total of the two modifiers. On a 10 or greater the target is returned to life, but the target gains a permanent -1 to all future resurrection rolls. On a 9 or lower the spell fails, the character gains a permanent -1 to all future resurrection rolls, and can only be returned by Ritual resurrection.

# Ritual Resurrection
When a spell that brings back the dead, with a casting time greater than one action is cast, follow the ritual resurrection rules. Ask for a spellcasting ability check from the caster, and note the modifier returned from the list below. Check the Permanent Modifiers of the target. Allow for characters participating in the ritual to provide up to three optional modifiers. Then roll a d20 adding all the modifiers, then consult the Resurrection Table to see what happens.

## Modifiers
When rolling for resurrection ensure that the proper modifiers are applied. For rapid resurrection you only add the Permanent Modifiers, and the spellcasting ability of the caster. For ritual resurrection you add the permanent modifiers, spellcasting ability of the caster as well as up to three optional modifiers.

## Permanent Modifiers
These are the modifiers that have been accumulated overtime by the character that apply to every resurrection roll. Examples include:

- Previous attempts: Previous resurrection attempts often come with a permanent modifier to subsequent rolls.
- Blessing: Perhaps the character was blessed by some entity, making it easier for them to return.
- Curse: Perhaps the character was cursed by some entity, making it harder for them to return.
- Done this Before: If a character has died and successfully returned 10 times their soul becomes accustomed to returning. From this point their permanent modifier becomes +5, and can never be reduced past +5.

## Spellcasting Ability
One of the factors that affects the outcome of a resurrection is the skill of the caster. Upon casting a spell to bring someone back from the dead the caster must make an ability check using their spellcasting ability.

- Nat 20: The resurrection roll gains a +3 modifier
- Greater than 20: The resurrection roll gains a +2 modifier
- 15-19: The resurrection roll gains a +1 modifier
- 10-14: The resurrection roll gains a +0 modifier
- 5-9: The resurrection roll gains a -1 modifier
- Less than 5: The resurrection roll gains a -2 modifier
- Nat 1: The resurrection roll gains a -3 modifier

## Optional Modifiers
In ritual resurrection up to three optional modifiers can be added. They can be any combination of the following.

### Skill Check
Skill checks can be made by those participating in the ritual to help the soul return. The person casting the spell to bring the target back cannot make a skill check. This relies on player creativity, they may beseech the fallen characters god, use their own magic to aid in the ritual or do something to directly reach out to the characters soul. Be flexible in what you allow, however if the idea has no chance of working inform them of that fact. If they still try to perform the idea you warned them against, treat it as an auto failure. In this scenario you can choose how bad the failure would be and modify the roll by 0, -1, -2, or -3. If their Idea is exceedingly good however consider allowing a bonus to their skill check, or advantage. Ideas with a low chance of working, that aren't impossible, may have a negative modifier or disadvantage.

- Nat 20: The resurrection roll gains a +3 modifier
- Greater than 20: The resurrection roll gains a +2 modifier
- 15-19: The resurrection roll gains a +1 modifier
- 10-14: The resurrection roll gains a +0 modifier
- 5-9: The resurrection roll gains a -1 modifier
- Less than 5: The resurrection roll gains a -2 modifier
- Nat 1: The resurrection roll gains a -3 modifier

### Magical Items
Magical items can be used to fuel the magic in resurrection spells. The more powerful the greater the effect.

- Common: Relying on such a weak item has consequences. The resurrection roll gains a -1 modifier. The item is destroyed.
- Uncommon: Not weak enough to have drawbacks, not strong enough to help. The resurrection roll gains no modifier. The item is destroyed.
- Rare: A small amount of power can be drawn from the item. The resurrection roll gains a +1 modifier. The item is destroyed.
- Very Rare: A moderate amount of power can be drawn from the item. The resurrection roll gains a +2 modifier. The item is destroyed.
- Legendary: A large amount of power can be drawn from the item. The resurrection roll gains a +3 modifier. The item is destroyed.
- Sentient Items: The attempt will fail if the item is unwilling. If the item is willing then it is treated as a sacrifice, see Life for a Life below.
- Artifacts: Artifacts will not yield to a resurrection ritual. The item is unaffected.

### Sacrifice
Characters may choose to sacrifice something of themselves. Sacrifices must be given willingly. Once a sacrifice is made it cannot be reversed without the use of higher magic, such as a wish spell. This falls to player creativity, and the modifier should reflect the severity of the sacrifice made. Sacrifices may include the following, but be flexible to player ideas.

- Minor Sacrifice: A character may try to sacrifice something of little worth to them. This will result in the sacrifice being made and no change to the roll. If the sacrifice given is truly trivial, consider a negative modifier.
    
- Power: A character may give up a source of power tied to them. I.E a warlock may give up their connection to their patron. Determine how severe the sacrifice is, and apply a modifier.
    
- Ability: A character may give up something they are skilled at. For example a fighter may sacrifice their skill with a sword. A rogue may give up their ability to sneak. A character could also choose to permanently lose a spell or multiple spells. They could also give up class features. Determine how severe the sacrifice is, and apply a modifier.
    
- Body: A character may sacrifice elements of their own body to fuel the spell. This may come in the form of a permanent ability score reduction, reduction of max hp, years of their life, or their own body parts. Determine how severe the sacrifice is, and apply a modifier.
    
- Life for a Life: A character may choose to willingly give up their life for the life of another. In this scenario the roll gains a +10.

## Additional Effects

### Boons

In rare cases characters come back stronger than they were. In these cases the DM determines a small permanent buff that is applied to the target. Boons can be fairly strong as they should happen only rarely, and are a reward for properly preparing for a resurrection. The boon is permanent and can only be removed by higher magic, such as the wish spell.

### Alterations

In some cases the resurrected character will return changed. This change is determined by the DM and should be neither positive or negative, just different. Alternatively the alteration could be a boon and an affliction, of similar potency. The alteration is permanent and can only be removed by higher magic, such as the wish spell.

### Afflictions

Characters brought back from the dead can be changed for the worse. In these cases the DM determines an affliction that now affects the character. Afflictions should only have a minor negative impact on the character, and importantly if it is a player character the affliction shouldn’t ruin that player's fun. The affliction is permanent and can only be removed by higher magic, such as the wish spell.

### Complications

When resurrections go very badly it can cause terrible complications. Perhaps a demon's soul is instead drawn into the body, or the attempt pulls all who attempted the ritual into the shadowfell. The DM determines the complication, but it should lead to a fun adventure, or encounter of some form.
