# Foreword
I have aimed to put together a comprehensive list of all available races. In Eldaris many of your preconceptions about races may be untrue, however you should find some familiar ideas. In almost all cases the specific lore behind each race will be changed from the standard to better fit the world. In rare cases this will mean the race will have a different name, in those cases the original name will be included so that you may find them with ease. On occasion I have made some mechanical change to a race, in these cases it will be highlighted after their brief lore. All Dragonmark and Esper Genesis Core Manual races/subraces have been deliberately excluded, and thus are not available. If you feel I have missed a race that would otherwise be available let me know.

# Mixed Parentage
To allow for additional flavouring of characters I have decided upon a loose system for mixed parentage, i.e. parents from different races. There may be exceptions to the rules below, these may be listed in a race's brief.

## The Likelihood of Children
In general mixed partnerships are much less likely to produce children. The chance is the highest with a human parent, human mothers especially. This is due to humans origins, and their connection with the weave providing them with innate adaptability. The chance is also increased with how similar physically the two races are. If the races are too dissimilar, or reproduce differently, then a child is not possible.

For example a dwarf and a halfling are less likely to have a child than a Dwarf and a Human. Further a human and an elf would be more likely to have a child than a human and a tabaxi. However a human and a dragonborn could never have children, as dragonborn hatch from eggs.

## The Results
Most commonly the child is the same race as their mother, with no changes coming from their father.  

Uncommonly the child is the same race as their mother, but with some physical characteristics from their father. For example a child with an elven mother and dwarven father would be a bit more short stocky than a standard elf, and may even be able to grow a very slight beard. Mechanically there is no change to the character, it is just aesthetic detail.

Rarely a half race can be born, such as half-elf and half-orc. This has only ever proven possible with humans, and only for the two races listed. Half races are rare because of this, especially as their bloodline tends towards one race or the other when they have children. Two half-elf parents are just as likely to have a human or an elf child, rather than another half-elf.

# Homebrew
In general I would prefer you to stick to what is available for races, as adding new races means more worldbuilding. There will be no "last of my kind" scenarios. If you want options that aren't usually possible look at the mixed parentage above. Still I am happy to consider UA/homebrew races and subraces, but they must be run by me first. To be accepted it must be balanced and able to fit into the world. Subraces have more of a chance of being accepted, but again I'd just stick to what is available.

# Race List

## Prime Races
As the name suggests these were the first mortal humanoid races to walk Eldaris. Whilst they were not created at exactly the same time they all share a similarly long history. On Eldaris some take great pride in being one of the prime races. Being the first does not however mean they are the most common in Eldaris Though that may be true for dwarves and humans, the orcs, corseeky and vedalken are all much rarer. Until the first dawn of ascension the prime races were the only humanoids on Eldaris
- [[Corseeky]] (Warforged)
- [[Dwarf]]
- [[Human]]
- [[Orc]]
- [[Vedalken]]

## Divergent Races
The divergent races are a motley bunch, they fit no broad racial grouping, hence being classified as divergent. The circumstances of their arrival in Eldaris varies from case to case. Their social structures are unique, and their physicalities diverse. Each has their own place in society. Oddly despite all their differences, or perhaps because of them, the divergent races feel an odd kinship to one another.
- [[Aarakocra]]
- [[Deep Gnome]]
- [[Duergar]]
- [[Gearforged]]
- [[Gith]]
- [[Gnome]]
- [[Goliath]]
- [[Halfling]]
- [[Kenku]]
- [[Triton]]

## Draconic Races
Since the times of the forging Teitsa'Var has belonged to the dragons. The land there is sacred to them, with some believing it is somehow tied to their awesome power. Alone in Teitsa'Var the dragons were unfulfilled. For a dragon is nothing without a hoard, and more than that dragons yearn to rule, be admired and even worshipped. So over the years they have allowed many humanoid races to settle Teitsa'Var, to fulfil their inborn desires. There are only three races however that have been shaped by the land, and it's rulers.
- [[Dragonborn]]
- [[Kobold]]
- [[Lizardfolk]]

## Fey-touched Races
The feywild is a mystical place, born from [[Kihena]] and touched by the minds of all. The feywild is an echo of the material plane. With the feelings of the material plane being reflected in the physicality of the feywild. Within the feywild arcana and nature are one, a beautiful, terrifying union. One that shapes the very plane itself and all it's denizens, making them as mystical as the land the hail from. A few such races have made The Divine Union their home.
- [[Centaur]]
- [[Eladrin]]
- [[Elf]]
- [[Fairy]]
- [[Firbolg]]
- [[Satyr]]

## Fragmented Isles Races
TODO
- [[Gnoll]]
- [[Harengon]]
- [[Leonin]]
- [[Loxodon]]
- [[Minotaur]]
- [[Owlin]]
- [[Ratfolk]]
- [[Ravenfolk]]
- [[Tabaxi]]
- [[Tortle]]
- [[Ursar]] (Bearfolk)

## Goblinoid Races
After the first dawn of ascension, humanity seemed on a path towards peace, this enraged [[Ruin]]. He decided to create the goblinoids, a group that would be fundamentally opposed to The Divine Empire. Being a relatively new god, [[Ruin]] did not understand that the goblinoids would not serve him totally, they had free will. Initially his influence over them was strong, but as the years passed his control faded. By the third era of The Divine Council, he had no more control over them than he did any other race. Now after the calamities and the fall of the union, few remember that the goblinoids were sometimes referred to as the races of [[Ruin]]. 
- [[Bugbear]]
- [[Goblin]]
- [[Hobgoblin]]

## Human Descendant Races
Humanity's connection to the weave of the world allows them to adapt to almost anything. This also means that they are affected by the weave on a greater scale than all other races. In certain circumstances this can force a change so great that it goes beyond mere adaptation, and causes a new race to be born. Due to this humanity is the progenitor race to many other races, all of which are listed below. The cause of mutation and stability of the new race is different in each case.
- [[Aasimar]]
- [[Changeling]]
- [[Genasi]]
- [[Half-Elf]]
- [[Half-Orc]]
- [[Scion]] (Kalashtar)
- [[Shifter]]
- [[Fused]] (Simic Hybrid)
- [[Tiefling]]
- [[Trollkin]]
- [[Yuan-Ti]]

## Gothic Lineages
TODO
- [[Dhampir]]
- [[Hexblood]]
- [[Reborn]]
