# World Premise
Eldaris was once a world where power flowed freely. The gods walked alongside mortals in their avatar forms, the very embodiment of their domain. The divines, which walked the line between mortal and god, lead their people with great strength, and an ageless perspective. Mortals were capable of achieving greatness beyond imagining. It was an age of gods, it was an age of heroes.

One group of heroes, The Faited Few, ushered in a golden age. From death itself, they rose to godlike power. They brought a decisive end to the Long Nights, the decennial apocalypse, that had shaped life on Eldaris for millennia. When the corruption of death itself threatened to bring the end of all life, The Faited Few ensured life would go on. For a century The Faited Few stood as bulwarks against evil. They were guardians of light and hope.

The calamities came without warning, and shattered Eldaris.

The first calamity was the banishment of the [[Primordial]] gods back to their home planes. Nobody knows what caused them to be banished, but all know what happened after. The domains of each of the [[Primordial]] gods became unstable. The gods without aspects lost control of their domains entirely for a while. The disasters that followed are thought to have killed over half the population of Eldaris.

The second calamity struck shortly after the first. The divines, the immortal leaders of The Divine Union, fell into a deep slumber, from which they still have not awakened. This prevented the divines shielding their people from the chaos that befell the [[Primordial]] domains.

No one knows when exactly the third calamity struck. It stole from Eldaris the one person who might have been able to stabilise the [[Primordial]] domains in absence of the gods. Ra, the nigh omnipotent emperor of the union, was found dead on his throne. His death was confirmed by The Faited Few, though they never hinted at how he may have died.

The fourth calamity came as the effects of the first came to an end, just as the [[Primordial]] domains regained stability. The Corseeky emerged from their towers intent on cleansing the world. They wished to reset the world to its original, perfect state. Though not as deadly as the first calamity, the fourth was clinical and exacting in its destruction. It would have been the end.

The fifth calamity was the fall of The Faited Few. To combat the corseeky menace, the Faited Few gathered all their members, present and past, to make one decisive strike against the corseeky sovereign. How the battle proceeded is unknown, we only the outcome. The corseeky hive disappeared almost overnight, returning to whence they came. When The Faited Few returned they did so as [[Primordial]] aspects, infused with godly power. For all but one, that power has corrupted them. The greatest heroes of Eldaris became the worlds greatest tyrants.

This was fifty years ago. The Divine Union carries on as a shell of its former self, ruled by coin and the whims of tyrants. This broken Union is your home, in this shattered world. The Union is all you have known, and to reclaim any of the power of Eldaris, you must leave it behind.

# Party Brief
Given the current state of the Union, the party has agreed to form and adventuring party, and go on a joint venture to a new continent. How you know each other, and your exact reasons for leaving the Union, will be covered in [[Character Creation]].

Where the party goes, at least initially, is up to you. I have three options listed below for you to look at. Before the start of the campaign all players must rank their preferred start option from 1 to 3, with 1 being the most preferred, and 3 being the least. This can be done anonymously, or you can discuss amongst yourselves. The option with the lowest score is the one we will go with.
- [[The One Day Empire]]
- [[The Isles of Fortune and Dread]]
- [[War of the Dragon Gods]]
