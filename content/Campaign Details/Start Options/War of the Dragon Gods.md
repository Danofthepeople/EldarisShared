# Brief
There two dragon gods, [[Imrag]] and [[Udremm]]. They, unaffected by the calamites, are locked in eternal war to claim Teitsa'Var and its people. The stalemate has held since the five calamities. Now the gods are calling for mercenaries across the world to join with them, and fight in the holy war. In return they offer might and blessings of dragon kind.

# Key Notes
- Characters might be motivated to go simply to fight. For those with aspirations beyond bloodshed, dragons have vast hordes to both pay you with and for you to steal from. The particularly ambitions might even be able to gain the favour of a god.
- Morality in this campaign is heavily dependent on the gods. Orders will be given, and while denying them is an option it might not be good for your health.
- A key part of this campaign would be warfare, and all its associated baggage. 
- This would be a very tactical campaign, where you would have to climb the ranks of the draconic hierarchy. This means performing well both martially, and politically.
