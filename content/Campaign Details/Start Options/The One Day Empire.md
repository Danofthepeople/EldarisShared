# Brief
A few years ago the continent to the east of the Union was the site of an incredible event. The continent was sealed off, and over the course of a single day an empire rose and fell. The people of this empire became known as the Prismari. Beyond their use light given form, lux, little is known about them. Now people from across Eldaris rush to the new frontier, in the hopes of claiming power the mysterious Prismari left behind. So far the world has only scratched the surface of what the Prismari were capable of.

# Key Notes
- Characters might be motivated to go to Prismar in search of wealth and power, the nation is practically overflowing with it after all, they say a year in Prismar is enough for most to retire young.  Some may see this as a new start, and wish to claim new lands, perhaps forge a new nation. The scholarly among you might go to uncover the mystery of the One Day Empire, because surely the more you understand, the more you can utilise what remains.
- Morality in this campaign is left entirely open to player preference.
- A key part of this campaign would involve exploring the remnants of a fallen empire, understanding its people, and claiming what power you can.
- You could think of the campaign as similar to the American gold rush. Everyone is going to Prismar to make their fortune, and the frontier is unforgiving.
