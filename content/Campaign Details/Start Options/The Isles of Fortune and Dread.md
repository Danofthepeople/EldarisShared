# Brief
The shattered isles have been known to the Union for centuries, yet they have barely been explored. Each island is akin to its own nation, with its own people. The islands are numerous and mysterious. In recent years something has begun to plague the waters of the isles, and madness seeps through the land. Some believe whatever shattered the isles is stirring once again. Despite this new ships are being chartered to the Shattered Isles almost every day, because with the stirring of madness has come the promise of otherworldly power.

# Key Notes
- Characters might be motivated to go the isles in search of power as rumours of artefacts spread. The pragmatic may go to secure abandoned trade routes, and make their fortune from exotic luxuries. The hopeful might simply go to see the varied cultures of the islands. The crazy might go in search of whatever horrors are awakening in the depths.
- Morality in this campaign is left entirely open to player preference.
- A key part of this campaign would involve naval travel. Ships, sailing, piracy, trading, are commonplace by necessity of geography.
- This option would see elements of cosmic horror introduced over time. Bare this in mind before you set off to a life of piracy.
